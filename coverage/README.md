# Coverage

### Illustrates how to create a coverage (raster layer).

The examples contain 2 steps:

* Upload a GeoTIFF file called dem.tiff
* Change the style of the created coverage to a style called 'dem'

**NB**: It's possible to upload the GeoTIFF file inside a ZIP file.
In this case just replace the content-type (use 'application/zip' instead of 'image/tiff').
